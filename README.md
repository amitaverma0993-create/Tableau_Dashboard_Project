# Tableau Dashboard_Daikibo Factory Telemetry Analysis

##**Project Overview**

This project was completed as part of a Deloitte - Data Analytics Job Simulation, where I analyzed machine telemetry data from multiple manufacturing factories using Tableau.

##**Objective**

The objective was to transform raw operational data into actionable business insights by building interactive dashboards.

##**Business Problem**
Daikibo collected telemetry data from machines across four global factories to understand operational efficiency and machine failures.
The client wanted answers to:
**1. Which factory experienced the highest machine downtime?
2. Which machine types failed most frequently in that factory?**
