# Tableau Dashboard_Daikibo Factory Telemetry Analysis

##**Project Overview**

This project was completed as part of a **Deloitte - Data Analytics Job Simulation**, where I analyzed machine telemetry data from multiple manufacturing factories using **Tableau**.

##**Objective**

The objective was to transform raw operational data into **actionable business insights** by building interactive **dashboards**.

##**Business Problem**

Daikibo collected telemetry data from machines across four global factories to understand operational efficiency and machine failures.
The client wanted answers to:

**1. Which factory experienced the highest machine downtime?\n
2. Which machine types failed most frequently in that factory?**

**Factory Locations:**

1. Daikibo Factory **Meiyo** – Tokyo, Japan\n
2. Daikibo Factory **Seiko** – Osaka, Japan\n
3. Daikibo **Berlin** – Germany\n
4. Daikibo **Shenzhen** – China\n

Each factory operates **9 machine types**, sending status messages every **10 minutes**.
